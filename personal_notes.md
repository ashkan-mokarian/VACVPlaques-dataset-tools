* Current labels are from trackmate simple LAP tracker. But this dataset has some properties that could be exploited.
For example the GFP intensities grow with time because of infection. So this could prove helpful for tracking and gap
closing and better spot detection. Could it be that their movement also changes depending on infection time.
